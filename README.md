Hi, my name is Jake Power, I am a junior at Florida State University, 
and I am a computer science major interested in Cybersecurity! This project is my very
own implementation of the New York Times' Wordle game, except with a few twists. Like
the original, my game is also designed to give users the chance to guess a word in 6 
tries, but unlike the original, mine keeps track of how many guesses the puzzle is 
solved in, and based on that a score is assigned. I also allow players to go back and 
forth with by asking if a player would like to enter a new username, and their score is 
assigned to their respective username. Once a user/s decide they've played enough, 
their total scores are uploaded to a text file
